# ProjectGettingCleaningData

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit:

1. a tidy data set: "tidyDataSet.txt"; 
2. a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis: https://github.com/EMFS/ProjectGettingCleaningData
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

The present README.md file explains how the 'run_analysis.R' script work.
Given that the script is run on a working directory that contains the "UCI HAR Dataset" with the train and test data, it will produce a txt file with the average of each variable of the data set for each activity and each subject.
